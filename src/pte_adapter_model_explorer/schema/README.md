# Bindings for the PTE schema

## ExecuTorch schema files

ExecuTorch's PTE schema files were taken from:

```
https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/v1.0.0/schema/
```

Where ExecuTorch's version was `v1.0.0`.

## ExecuTorch bindings

Python bindings for ExecuTorch's PTE schema were generated by `scripts/flatbuffer-gen.sh` where flatbuffer's version was `v25.12.19`.

These should be re-generated every time we change either ExecuTorch's or flatbuffer's version.
