# Bindings for the PTE schema

## ExecuTorch schema files

ExecuTorch's PTE schema files were taken from:

```
https://github.com/pytorch/executorch/tree/v1.0.0/schema/
```

Where ExecuTorch's version was `v1.0.0`.

## ExecuTorch bindings

Python bindings for ExecuTorch's PTE schema were generated by:

```
flatc -o pte_bindings --python path/to/executorch/schema/program.fbs path/to/executorch/schema/scalar_type.fbs
```

... where flatbuffer's version was `v25.9.23`.
These should be re-generated every time we change either ExecuTorch's or flatbuffer's version.
